				<h2>History of the Horus Heresy</h2>
				<p>
					The Horus Heresy marks one of the darkest and most catastrophic
					periods in the history of the Warhammer 40k universe. It was a
					galactic civil war that saw the very heart of the Imperium shattered
					by betrayal. At the center of this conflict was Horus Lupercal, the
					Emperor's most trusted and beloved son, and the Warmaster of the
					<a
						href="https://warhammer40k.fandom.com/wiki/Great_Crusade"
						target="_blank"
						>Great CrusadeðŸ”—</a
					>, tasked with uniting the galaxy under the banner of humanity. The
					seeds of rebellion were sown when Horus was corrupted by the Chaos
					Gods during a campaign on the planet Davin. They manipulated his pride
					and ambition, turning him against his father, the
					<a
						href="https://warhammer40k.fandom.com/wiki/Emperor_of_Mankind"
						target="_blank"
						>The Emperor of MankindðŸ”—</a
					>. What followed was a brutal war as Horus, along with nine other
					Primarchs and their legions, fell to the lure of Chaos and declared
					their rebellion against the
					<a
						href="https://warhammer40k.fandom.com/wiki/Imperium_of_Man"
						target="_blank"
						>ImperiumðŸ”—</a
					>. This schism divided the galaxy, with brothers fighting brothers in
					a conflict that would reshape the fate of mankind forever.

				<h3>The Betrayal of Horus</h3>
				<p>
					Once considered the most loyal of the Emperor's sons, Horus's fall
					from grace is regarded as the greatest betrayal in human history.
					Initially, the Emperor had granted him the title of Warmaster, making
					him the supreme commander of all the
					<a
						href="https://warhammer40k.fandom.com/wiki/Space_Marine_Legions"
						target="_blank"
						>Legiones AstartesðŸ”—</a
					>. However, the weight of this responsibility, coupled with the
					poisonous whispers of the Chaos Gods, gradually eroded Horus's
					loyalty. His betrayal began in secret, with subtle manipulations of
					other
					<a
						href="https://warhammer40k.fandom.com/wiki/Primarch"
						target="_blank"
						>PrimarchsðŸ”—</a
					>
					and legions. As Horus succumbed to the powers of Chaos, he forged
					alliances with the traitor legions, convincing them to rise up against
					the Emperor. When his treachery became public, it plunged the galaxy
					into civil war, known as the Horus Heresy. Loyalist legions led by the
					Emperorâ€™s faithful sons clashed with the traitors in a war that
					consumed countless worlds.

				<h3>The Battle at the Imperial Palace</h3>
				<p>
					The Horus Heresy reached its dramatic climax in the
					<a
						href="https://wh40k.lexicanum.com/wiki/Siege_of_Terra"
						target="_blank"
						>Siege of TerraðŸ”—</a
					>, where Horus and his forces launched a direct assault on the
					<a
						href="https://warhammer40k.fandom.com/wiki/Imperial_Palace"
						target="_blank"
						>Imperial PalaceðŸ”—</a
					>
					on Earth. After seven years of brutal warfare across the galaxy, the
					traitor legions closed in on the Throneworld, and the final battle for
					humanity's future unfolded. The traitor legions unleashed unimaginable
					destruction, but the Imperial forces stood firm. After weeks of
					relentless fighting, Horus took a bold risk. He lowered the shields of
					his battle barge, daring the Emperor to face him in single combat. The
					Emperor, alongside his loyal sons and the
					<a
						href="https://warhammer40k.fandom.com/wiki/Adeptus_Custodes"
						target="_blank"
						>Custodian GuardðŸ”—</a
					>, teleported aboard Horus's flagship, the Vengeful Spirit, for a
					final confrontation. In a tragic and devastating duel, the Emperor,
					gravely wounded, ultimately struck down Horus. However, the cost was
					immense. The Emperorâ€™s mortal body was shattered, leaving him bound to
					the
					<a
						href="https://warhammer40k.fandom.com/wiki/Golden_Throne"
						target="_blank"
						>Golden ThroneðŸ”—</a
					>, where he would remain for eternity to guide humanity. The galaxy,
					once united under the Emperorâ€™s vision, was left in ruins, forever
					scarred by the Horus Heresy. The echoes of this betrayal and the war
					that followed still shape the Imperium 10,000 years later.
